    "disclaimer" : "The health screening may identify certain medical risk factors, conditions or diseases but is not intended to be a comprehensive full health screening or to replace medical consultation for any medical symptoms or concerns. The absence of any abnormal findings in the screening results should never be treated as a guarantee that any medical conditions are not or will not be present. You are advised to continue to be vigilant in observing for any symptoms associated with these conditions, and to seek medical attention when in doubt. Some conditions including fever and other illnesses during or shortly before the time of the screening may affect the interpretation of the results and therefore you are advised to see your doctor for interpretation of the health report. Please ensure you meet the eligibility criteria before you return for your next health screening. \n\nShould you have any queries, feel free to contact us at hello@publichealthservice.org. Thank you for participating in PHS 2025 and we hope that you have benefited and would continue to support us in the future. "
